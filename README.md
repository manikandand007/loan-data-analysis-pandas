Visualizations & Analysis
 1️⃣ Bar Plot – Loan Amount by Channel & Contract Type
- Compared **average loan amounts** across different **channel types**
- Used contract type as a hue to identify differences in loan behavior
Insight:
Certain channels process higher loan amounts, especially for specific contract types.
2️⃣ Scatter Plot – Loan Amount vs Decision Time
- Analyzed the relationship between **loan amount requested** and
days taken for approval
- Helped identify approval trends for larger loans
Insight: 
Higher loan amounts generally require longer approval time.
3️⃣ Bar Plot – Loan Amount by Contract Status
- Compared **approved vs rejected contracts**
- Highlighted differences in loan amounts across contract types
Insight:
Approved contracts tend to have higher average loan amounts.
4️⃣ Line Plot – Payment Count vs Annuity Payment
- Analyzed **annuity payment trends** based on the number of payments
- Segmented analysis by **client type**
**Insight:**  
Different client types show distinct annuity payment patterns over time.
